# Separation Logic and Mutability

This is an in-progress formalisation of a short paper on an extension of Separation Logic for describing mutability.

It contains:
  * a formalisation of Separation Logic from first principles, described in the `src/SeparationLogic` folder.
  * a formalisation of the mutability extension, based on the original Separation Logic, described in the `src/SeparationLogicWithMutability` folder.
